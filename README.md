![Markdown Editor Screenshot](/markdown.jpg)

A simple markdown generator that doesn't retain information. Responsive, and with a basic set of functions I use. This is pure HTML, CSS, and JS.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 Real-time Markdown editing and preview
- 🌓 Light and Dark mode toggle
- 🖥️ Fullscreen mode for distraction-free editing
- 📋 One-click copy of formatted content
- 🛠️ Toolbar for quick Markdown formatting
- 📱 Responsive design - works on desktop and mobile

## 🛠️ Things I used

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design
- [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/) for the text editor
- [Marked](https://marked.js.org/) for Markdown parsing

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/markdown-editor.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```

   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser.

An well that's it!
